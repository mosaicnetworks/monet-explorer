# Purpose

The purpose of each page will be detailed here. This will help provide a more detail understanding the thought process that was carried to determine the place of each of the element on a page.

## Index (`containers/Index.tsx`)

This page should be very quick overview of the network and its status. It should include things like:

-   Current Validators
-   Last 10 blocks
-   Last 20 transactions
-   Network statistics
    -   Tolerance
-   Nominees (if any)
-   Whether a validator is whitelisted

This should be the page that at glance can give as much information as possible. This will be used by Martin and Jon to quickly the see status of any test network, preferably both local and remote.
